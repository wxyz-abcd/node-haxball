#### üíª Installing

```sh
npm install node-haxball
```

#### üíª Module Usage Example

Joining a room:

```js
const { Room, Utils } = require("node-haxball");

Utils.generateAuth().then(([authKey, authObj])=>{
  Room.join({
    id: "Olnit_iGRWs",
    authObj: authObj
  }, {
    storage: {
      player_name: "wxyz-abcd",
      avatar: "üëΩ"
    }, 
    onSuccess: (room)=>{
      const { name } = room.getRoomData();
      room.sendChat("Hello " + name);
      room.onAfterRoomLink = (roomLink)=>{
        console.log("room link:", roomLink);
      };
    }
  });

<h2 id="docs">üì∞ Mini-Documentation</h2>

- `Library constructor(object, config)`: Initializes the library with given parameters. This constructor is only for browsers & custom environments.
  - `object`: These are objects/functions that directly affect the core functionalities. You should usually pass "window" here, because most of these objects reside there.
    - `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, (if you are on a custom environment such as NW.js or Electron, these functions should be binded to browser's window object before being passed on.)
    - `console`, `performance`, `crypto`, (browser's window object should have these objects as well.)
    - `RTCPeerConnection`, `RTCIceCandidate`, `RTCSessionDescription`, `WebSocket`, `XMLHttpRequest`, (these classes are used by Haxball for communication, browser's window object should have these classes as well.)
    - `JSON5`, `pako`. (These are two external libraries required by Haxball.)
  - `config`: Custom configuration. Valid object keys are;
    - `WebSocketChangeOriginAllowed`: true/false. browsers' websocket libraries do not allow origin change for security reasons, so we need a proxy server to change the websocket request's origin for us. If true, we do not need a proxy server. (we can do that in NW.js, for example)
    - `WebSocketProxyUrl`: proxy websocket url address to use when trying to create or join a room. should end with a "/". Is appended "host" or "client" at the end while being used. Defaults to: "wss://p2p.haxball.com/" for host and "wss://p2p2.haxball.com/" for client.
    - `HttpProxyUrl`: proxy http url address to use when trying to create or join a room. should end with a "/". Is appended "host" or "client" at the end while being used. Defaults to: "https://www.haxball.com/rs/".

- `Utils`: Some static utility functions.

  - `generateAuth()`: generates a new `player_auth_key` along with its companion auth object. you should store the key and use it later if you want to be recognized in Haxball rooms. the object is used in `Room.join`. returns `Promise([authKey, authObj])`
  - `authFromKey(authKey)`: recreates the auth object for given `authKey`. the object is used in `Room.join`. returns `Promise(authObj)`
  - `getRoomList()`: returns the current room list. returns `Promise(roomListArray)`
  - `keyState(dirX, dirY, kick)`: returns an integer key state value to be used in `Room.setKeyState`. dirX = oneof\[-1:left, 0:still, 1:right\], dirY = oneof\[-1:up, 0:still, 1:down\], kick = true/false.
  - `getGeo()`: connects to Haxball's geolocation API to get your location based on IP address. you can use it directly as "geo" key inside "storage" object. returns `Promise(geoLocationObject)`

- `Room`: Main static room functions.
  - `create(createParams, commonParams)`: create a room with given parameters.
    - `createParams`: {
      - `name`: name of the room.
      - `password`: password to protect the room. can be set null/undefined for no password.
      - `token`: get a recaptcha token from www.haxball.com/headlesstoken and write it here to bypass the loop of trying to solve recaptcha.
      - `noPlayer`: set it to true if you are planning to host the room without actually playing the game, otherwise set it to false.
      - `geo`: `{lat: latitude(number), lon: longitude(number), flag: 2 letter country flag(string)}` geolocation values of the room about to be created.
      - `playerCount`: if set to a number, always fixes the player count to this specific number.
      - `maxPlayerCount`: the maximum allowed player count in the room.
      - `unlimitedPlayerCount`: if set to true, bypasses the player count controller.
      - `fakePassword`: if set to true, the room will show that it is password-protected while in fact it is not.
      - `showInRoomList`: set to true if you want this room to show up in the room list.
    }.
    - `commonParams`: explained below in `Room.join`.

  - `join(joinParams, commonParams)`: try to join the room(roomId) with given password(or null=no password). returns `Promise(room)` which is rejected if failed.
    - `joinParams`: {
      - `id`: the id of the room to join. for example, if the room link is https://www.haxball.com/play?c=31IBNI3w4F0, this room's id is `31IBNI3w4F0`.
      - `password`: a password value to join the room if the room is password-protected.
      - `token`: if the room is recaptcha-protected, you have to use a client token. currently there is not a clean way of doing this except using the NW.js token generator project, so you might want to look at it.
      - `authObj`: an auth object that has to be initialized by `Utils.generateAuth()` or `Utils.authFromKey()` before being used here.
    }
    - `commonParams`: {

      --- properties section ---

      - `storage`: {
        - `crappy_router`: if true, sets some timeout value to 10 seconds instead of 4 seconds while joining a room.

        - `fps_limit`: if 1, fps limit is set to 30, otherwise no limit is set.
        - `player_name`: name of the player. defaults to "abc".

      - `plugins`: array of `Plugin`'s to be used.
      - `version`: Haxball's version number. other clients cannot join this room if their version number is different than this number. default is 9.

The default callback value is a function that parses a chat message and returns `{ isCommand: boolean, data: string array }` where `isCommand = text.startsWith("!")` and `data = text.trimEnd().split(" ")`. 
    - `acceptEvent = onAfterOperationReceived(obj, msg, customData)`: runs for each message received from clients. `obj` is the operation type object, `msg` is the original message, `customData` is the return value of callback `onBeforeOperationReceived(obj, msg)`. `onBeforeOperationReceived` is called only once for each message, before all `onOperationReceived` callbacks of all plugins are called for the same message. you may modify msg's contents here as you wish. return true -> accept event, return false -> block message from being processed, throw exception -> break message sender player's connection. host-only.

  - `callbacks`:
    - `customData = onBeforeXXXXXXX(...)`: (where XXXXXXX is the name of the event) called before plugin callbacks. return a customData object to be used for each `plugin.onXXXXXXX(..., customData)` and then `room.onAfterXXXXXXX(..., customData)`. return false to stop propagation.
