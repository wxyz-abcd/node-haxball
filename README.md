<h2 id="how-to-use">ü§î How To Use</h2>

#### üíª Installing & importing as a node.js/CommonJS module:

```sh
npm install node-haxball
```
```js
const { OperationType, VariableType, ConnectionState, AllowFlags, Callback, Utils, Room, Replay, RoomConfig, Plugin, Renderer, Impl } = require("node-haxball");
// Use example code here.
```

#### üíª Usage on Browser

  - NOTE: Usage on Browser currently relies on our <a href="https://abc-haxball-proxy.up.railway.app">proxy server</a>. (Will expire at the end of each month and not work for several days.)
  - If you do not wish to use proxy server (which has some limitations), you will need our browser extension to change headers. (look at haxballOriginModifier project.)
  - <a href="https://abc-haxball-proxy.infinityfreeapp.com/?no_proxy_server=true">Alternate URL</a> (No proxy server yet.)

#### üíª Example code using the library:

Joining a room:

```js

Utils.generateAuth().then(([authKey, authObj])=>{
  Room.join({
    id: "Olnit_iGRWs",
    authObj: authObj
  }, {
    storage: {
      player_name: "wxyz-abcd",
      avatar: "üëΩ"
    }, 
    onSuccess: (room)=>{
      const { name } = room.getRoomData();
      room.sendChat("Hello " + name);
    }
  });
});
```

Creating a room:

```js

Room.create({
  name: "room123", 
  password: "password", 
  showInRoomList: true, 
  maxPlayerCount: 8,
  token: "thr1.AAAAAGNMOokNqt3forXs_Q.3qQMuLQOS9o"
}, {
  storage: {
    player_name: "wxyz-abcd",
    avatar: "üëΩ"
  }, 
  onSuccess: (room)=>{
    const { name } = room.getRoomData();
    room.sendChat("Hello " + name);
    room.onAfterRoomLink = (roomLink)=>{
      console.log("room link:", roomLink);
    };
  }
});
```

<h2 id="docs">üì∞ Mini-Documentation</h2>

- `Library constructor(object, config)`: Initializes the library with given parameters. This constructor is only for browsers & custom environments.
  - `object`: These are objects/functions that directly affect the core functionalities. You should usually pass "window" here, because most of these objects reside there.
    - `setTimeout`, `clearTimeout`, `setInterval`, `clearInterval`, `requestAnimationFrame`, `cancelAnimationFrame`, (if you are on a custom environment such as NW.js or Electron, these functions should be binded to browser's window object before being passed on.)
    - `console`, `performance`, `crypto`, (browser's window object should have these objects as well.)
    - `RTCPeerConnection`, `RTCIceCandidate`, `RTCSessionDescription`, `WebSocket`, `XMLHttpRequest`, (these classes are used by Haxball for communication, browser's window object should have these classes as well.)
    - `JSON5`, `pako`. (These are two external libraries required by Haxball.)
  - `config`: Custom configuration. You may pass `null` here if you want to use other methods of applying origin change such as using our browser extension(look at `haxballOriginModifier` folder of this repo). Valid object keys are;
    - `WebSocketChangeOriginAllowed`: browsers' websocket libraries do not allow origin change for security reasons, so we need a proxy server to change the websocket request's origin for us. If `true`, we do not need a proxy server. (we can do that in NW.js, for example)
    - `WebSocketProxyUrl`: proxy websocket url address to use when trying to create or join a room. should end with a `/`. Is appended `host` or `client` at the end while being used. Defaults to: `wss://p2p.haxball.com/` for host and `wss://p2p2.haxball.com/` for client.
    - `HttpProxyUrl`: proxy http url address to use when trying to create or join a room. should end with a `/`. Is appended `host` or `client` at the end while being used. Defaults to: `https://www.haxball.com/rs/`.

- `OperationType`: Different types of operations that are being used by Haxball. Should be used to understand what kind of message we are dealing with inside callback `onOperationReceived`.
- `VariableType`: Different types of variables that can be defined in a Plugin or a Renderer with its corresponding `defineVariable` function. Should be used in a GUI environment.
- `ConnectionState`: Different connection state values. Should be used while joining a room using `Room.join`.
- `AllowFlags`: These flags allow us to understand whether a plugin or a roomConfig is able to work correctly while joining or creating a room. Especially useful in a GUI environment.

- `Callback`: Global functions to add/remove callbacks.
    - `add(eventName, metadata)`: creates all callbacks about a new event called `eventName` which should start with a capital letter. `metadata` is not used, but this is the library's current metadata structure: `{ params: array of string }`. should be used (and maybe overridden for usage of `metadata`) in a gui application to define custom event callbacks related to gui events such as keyboard, mouse, touch, timer etc. the main event callback defined in this room object to trigger all callbacks is `"_on" + eventName`.
    - `remove(eventName)`: destroys the callbacks created by `Callback.add`.

- `Replay`: Functions/classes related to replays.

  - `read(uint8Array, callbacks, options)`: Creates and returns a non-blocking replay reader object. 

    - Parameters: 
      - `uint8Array`: Must be an Uint8Array containing the contents of a .hbr file. (Currently, only version 3 is supported.)
      - `callbacks`: An object that has the same callbacks as the renderer template. (maybe except the `onCustomEvent` callback that the replay files do not contain its corresponding event.)
      - `options`: An object that may contain the following keys:
        - `requestAnimationFrame`: Override function for `requestAnimationFrame`. (`null` = use library's default `requestAnimationFrame`.)
        - `cancelAnimationFrame`: Override function for `cancelAnimationFrame`. (`null` = use library's default `cancelAnimationFrame`.)
        - `fps_limit`: Any positive number that will be used as the fps limit. (`null` = no limit)

    - Returning replay reader object:
      - properties:
        - `roomData`: An object containing all information about the current room state.
      - functions:
        - `length()`: Returns the length of replay content in milliseconds.
        - `getTime()`: Returns the current time in milliseconds.
        - `setTime(destinationTime)`: Plays the replay until the `destinationTime`(in milliseconds) or end of replay is reached. Note that it may take some time to reach the destination time(especially if you are trying to rewind time), because the game state data is generated on the fly and not stored in memory. (It would probably use huge amounts of RAM.)
        - `setSpeed(coefficient)`: Changes the speed of playing the replay. `coefficient` must be a real number >=0. 
          - `coefficient` = 0 : stop replay.
          - 0 < `coefficient` < 1 : slow-motion replay.
          - `coefficient` = 1 : normal speed replay.
          - `coefficient` > 1 : fast-motion replay.
        - `destroy()`: Frees the resources that are used by this object.
      - callbacks:
        - `onDestinationTimeReached()`: Destination time has been reached. Runs after a call to `setTime(destinationTime)`.
        - `onEnd()`: The end of replay data has been reached.

- `Utils`: Some static utility functions.

  - `generateAuth()`: generates a new `player_auth_key` along with its companion auth object. you should store the key and use it later if you want to be recognized in Haxball rooms. the object is used in `Room.join`. returns `Promise([authKey, authObj])`
  - `authFromKey(authKey)`: recreates the auth object for given `authKey`. the object is used in `Room.join`. returns `Promise(authObj)`
  - `getRoomList()`: returns the current room list. returns `Promise(roomListArray)`
  - `keyState(dirX, dirY, kick)`: returns an integer key state value to be used in `Room.setKeyState`. `dirX` = oneof\[`-1`:left, `0`:still, `1`:right\], `dirY` = oneof\[`-1`:up, `0`:still, `1`:down\], `kick` = `true`/`false`.
  - `getGeo()`: connects to Haxball's geolocation API to get your location based on IP address. you can use it directly as `geo` key inside `storage` object. returns `Promise(geoLocationObject)`
  - `getDefaultStadiums()`: get default stadium array.
  - `parseStadium(textDataFromHbsFile, onError)`: parse text as a stadium object and return it.
  - `exportStadium(stadium)`: generate and return text(.hbs) content from a `stadium` object.

- `Room`: The class that currently hosts all room operations. Should only be initialized by either `Room.join` or `Room.create`.
  - `static functions`: These functions are used to create/join a room.
    - `create(createParams, commonParams)`: create a room with given parameters.
      - `createParams`:
        - `name`: name of the room.
        - `password`: password to protect the room. can be set `null`/`undefined` for no password.
        - `token`: get a recaptcha token from `www.haxball.com/headlesstoken` and write it here to bypass the loop of trying to solve recaptcha.
        - `noPlayer`: set it to `true` if you are planning to host the room without actually playing the game, otherwise set it to `false`.
        - `geo`: `{lat: latitude(number), lon: longitude(number), flag: 2 letter country flag(string)}` geolocation values of the room about to be created.
        - `playerCount`: if set to a `number`, always fixes the player count to this specific `number`.
        - `maxPlayerCount`: the maximum allowed player count in the room.
        - `unlimitedPlayerCount`: if set to `true`, bypasses the player count controller.
        - `fakePassword`: if set to `true`, the room will show that it is password-protected while in fact it is not.
        - `showInRoomList`: set to `true` if you want this room to show up in the room list.
      - `commonParams`: explained below in `Room.join`.

    - `join(joinParams, commonParams)`: try to join the room(`roomId`) with given `password`(or `null`=no password). returns `Promise(room)` which is rejected if failed.
      - `joinParams`:
        - `id`: the id of the room to join. for example, if the room link is `https://www.haxball.com/play?c=31IBNI3w4F0`, this room's id is `31IBNI3w4F0`.
        - `password`: a password value to join the room if the room is password-protected.
        - `token`: if the room is recaptcha-protected, you have to use a client token. currently there is not any other clean way of doing this except using the NW.js token generator project, so you might want to look at it.
        - `authObj`: an auth object that has to be initialized by `Utils.generateAuth()` or `Utils.authFromKey()` before being used here.
      - `commonParams`:
        --- properties section ---
        - `storage`:
          - `crappy_router`: if `true`, sets some timeout value to `10` seconds instead of `4` seconds while joining a room.
          - `extrapolation`: use the future(+) or past(-) values of game state while rendering or other kinds of processing. this value should be a number between `-200`ms and `+200`ms.
          - `fps_limit`: if `1`, fps limit is set to 30, otherwise no limit is set.
          - `player_name`: name of the player. default value is `"abc"`.
          - `avatar`: avatar of the player. default value is `null`.
          - `geo`:
            - `lat`: latitude value (number, default value is `40`).
            - `lon`: longitude value (number, default value is `40`).
            - `flag`: 2 letter country code (string, default value is `"tr"`).
          - `onValueSet(key, value)`: a callback function that is called just after the value of a key of this object has been changed by this library. default value is `null`.
        - `noPluginMechanism`: if `true`, renderer and plugin mechanism will not work. Should only be used for optimal performance. You have to define Room._onXXXXXX callbacks by yourself.
        - `useDefaultChatCommandMechanism`: if `false`, you will have to write `onBeforeOperationReceived` and `onAfterOperationReceived` callbacks by yourself. By default, `onBeforeOperationReceived` is a function that determines whether a chat message is a command or not by looking at the chat message's first character(should be '!'); and `onAfterOperationReceived` is a function that blocks these command messages from being sent to the clients. All plugins can run their own `onOperationReceived` after this `onBeforeOperationReceived` function call, and all of them can block/modify all messages before the messages reach to `onAfterOperationReceived`.
        - `config`: the `RoomConfig` object that contains all the main callbacks of this room. the object should be derived from the provided `RoomConfig` class. default value is `null`.
        - `renderer`: the `Renderer` object that can render the game. the object should be derived from the provided `Renderer` class. default value is `null`.
        - `plugins`: array of `Plugin` objects to be used. the objects should be derived from the provided `Plugin` class. default value is `[]`.
        - `version`: Haxball's version number. other clients cannot join this room if their version number is different than this number. default value is `9`.
        - `kickTimeout`: when you kick the ball, it causes you to release kick button by default. this library changes it so that it causes a timeout that makes you automatically press kick button again. default value is `20`(msec).

        --- event callbacks section ---
        - `onSuccess(room)`: joined/created `room`.
        - `onFailure(error)`: join room failed with error(`error`).
        - `onLeave(msg)`: triggered while leaving the room with reason(`msg`).
        - `onConnectionStateChange(state)`: connection state has just changed to (`state`).
        - `onReverseConnection()`: trying reverse connection while joining a room.
        - `onRequestRecaptcha()`: recaptcha is required while joining or creating a room.

        --- event triggers section ---
        - `cancel()`: should be used to cancel the process of joining a room.
        - `useRecaptchaToken(token)`: should be used to send the recaptcha token after `onRequestRecaptcha` event occurred. currently only working while creating a room. workaround: in order to send the token to try and join a recaptcha-protected room, cleanup old resources and use `Room.join` with the new token.

  - `fake event triggers`: these functions are intended to be used in host mode to create/control in-memory bot players that will run much more efficiently than standard networking bot players. they also work for normal player objects, and can be used to create some events belonging to a player that did not originate from that player. most of these fake events also trigger an `onOperationReceived` call before being sent to clients.
    - `fakePlayerJoin(id, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth)`: triggers a fake join room event; which in turn creates a new in-memory player object. If there was a player before with this id, old resources are automatically reassigned to this new player object, and that player will wake up. 0 <= `id` <= 65535, all the other parameters must be a string. 
    - `fakePlayerLeave(id)`: triggers a fake leave room event. returns the player's properties so that you may pass them to `fakePlayerJoin` at a later time to wake that player. passing `id` = 0 causes desync on clients (because there's a special check for the case `id` = 0 in original clients). the player, although seemingly leaving the room, still watches the room, waiting for a fake player join event. all parameters except `id` may be different in the new `fakePlayerJoin` call, which allows player's `name`, `flag`, `avatar`, `conn` and `auth` to change without the player entirely leaving the room.

    - `fakeSetKickRateLimit(min, rate, burst, byId)`: triggers a fake kick rate limit change event that apparently came from `player(byId)`. `min`, `rate`, `burst`>=0.
    - `fakeSetTeamColors(teamId, angle, colors, byId)`: triggers `team(teamId)`'s colors change event that apparently came from `player(byId)`. 0<=`angle`<=180, `colors` must be an array of type (0 <= `integer` <= 16777215) that contains at most 4 integers.
    - `fakeKickPlayer(playerId, reason, ban, byId)`: triggers `player(playerId)`'s kick/ban fake event that apparently came from `player(byId)`. `reason` must be a string, `ban` must be `true` or `false`.

- `RoomConfig`: A class that defines a room configuration object. Room configurations should be based on this class.

  - `constructor(metadata)`: creates a new `RoomConfig` instance. `metadata` is the information that you would want to show/update inside a GUI application.

  - `abstract callbacks`: These functions should be overridden when writing a GUI application using this API before creating any `RoomConfig` object. These are defined in `RoomConfig.prototype`.
    - `defineMetadata(metadata)`: Does nothing, returns nothing by default. This function should define the given `metadata` object inside this `RoomConfig` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the default roomConfig in the examples folder uses the following `metadata` structure: `{name, version, author, description, allowFlags}`.
    - `defineVariable(variable)`: Does nothing, returns `variable`'s value by default. This function should define the given `variable` object inside this `RoomConfig` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the default roomConfig in the examples folder use the following variable structure: `{name, type, value, range, description}`. This function should return the value of the `variable`, and should be used whenever a variable whose value is changeable from outside will be defined. 

  - `modifier callbacks`:
    - `[dataArray, customData] = modifyPlayerDataBefore(playerId, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth)`: set player's data just before player has joined the room. dataArray format should be `[modifiedName, modifiedFlag, modifiedAvatar]`. if `dataArray` is `null`, player is not allowed to join. also prepares a custom data object to send to all plugins. `customData=false` means "don't call callbacks". host-only.
    - `[modifiedName, modifiedFlag, modifiedAvatar] = modifyPlayerData(playerId, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth, customData)`: set player's data just before player has joined the room. `return null` -> player is not allowed to join. host-only.
    - `[modifiedName, modifiedFlag, modifiedAvatar] = modifyPlayerDataAfter(playerId, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth, customData)`: set player's data just before player has joined the room. `return null` -> player is not allowed to join. host-only.

    - `newPing = modifyPlayerPingAfter(playerId, ping, customData)`: set player's `ping`. host-only.
    - `[newPing, customData] = modifyClientPingBefore(ping)`: prepares a custom data object to send to all plugins while setting current player's `ping`. `customData=false` means "don't call callbacks". client-only.
    - `newPing = modifyClientPing(ping, customData)`: set current player's `ping`. client-only.

    - `[newFrameNo, customData] = modifyFrameNoBefore(frameNo)`: prepares a custom data object to send to all plugins while setting current player's `frameNo`. `customData=false` means "don't call callbacks". causes your player to look laggy to your opponents, especially on extrapolated clients. client-only.
    - `newFrameNo = modifyFrameNo(frameNo)`: set current player's `frameNo`. causes your player to look laggy to your opponents, especially on extrapolated clients. client-only.
    - `newFrameNo = modifyFrameNoAfter(frameNo, customData)`: set current player's `frameNo`. causes your player to look laggy to your opponents, especially on extrapolated clients. client-only.
    - `customData = onBeforeOperationReceived(obj, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo)`: the host callback that is called only once for each message received from clients, and its return value is passed as customData to onOperationReceived callback. this callback is useful for parsing chat messages and other stuff that you would like to do only once, before the room callback or any plugin callbacks are called. The default callback value is a function that parses a chat message and returns `{ isCommand: boolean, data: string array }` where `isCommand = text.startsWith("!")` and `data = text.trimEnd().split(" ")`. 
    - `acceptEvent = onOperationReceived(obj, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo, customData)`: runs for each message received from clients. `obj` is the operation type object, `msg` is the original message, `customData` is the return value of callback `onBeforeOperationReceived(obj, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo)`. `onOperationReceived` is called only once for each message, before all `onOperationReceived` callbacks of all plugins are called for the same message. you may modify msg's contents here as you wish. `return true` -> accept event, `return false` -> block message from being processed, `throw exception` -> break message sender player's connection. host-only.
    - `acceptEvent = onAfterOperationReceived(obj, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo, customData)`: runs for each message received from clients. `obj` is the operation type object, `msg` is the original message, `customData` is the return value of callback `onOperationReceived(obj, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo, msg)`. `onAfterOperationReceived` is called only once for each message, after all `onOperationReceived` callbacks of all plugins are called for the same message. you may modify msg's contents here as you wish. `return true` -> accept event, `return false` -> block message from being processed, `throw exception` -> break message sender player's connection. host-only.

    - `finalize()`: only called once while leaving a room, or during a call to `Room.setConfig`.
    - `customData = onBeforeXXXXXXX(...)`: (where `XXXXXXX` is the name of the event) called before plugin callbacks. return a `customData` object to be used for each `plugin.onXXXXXXX(..., customData)` and then `room.onAfterXXXXXXX(..., customData)`. return `false` to stop propagation. 
    - `onXXXXXXX(..., customData)`: (where `XXXXXXX` is the name of the event) called after plugin callbacks, just before renderer callback. the last parameter, `customData`, is the data object that was returned from `room.onBeforeXXXXXXX(...)`.

- `Plugin`: A class that defines a plugin. Any plugin should be based on this class.

  - `constructor(name, active, metadata)`: creates a new Plugin instance. A plugin is automatically activated just after initialization, while a Room object is being created, if active is true. Metadata is the information that you would want to show/update inside a GUI application.

  - `properties`:
    - `name`: name of the plugin. Must be unique, and is used internally in `Room.setPluginActive`. All Plugins can be accessed with their names via `Room.pluginsMap[name]`.
    - `active`: activation status of the plugin. You should use `Room.setPluginActive(name, active)` if you want to modify this value manually.

  - `abstract callbacks`: These functions should be overridden when writing a GUI application using this API before creating any `Plugin` object. These are defined in `Plugin.prototype`.
    - `defineMetadata(metadata)`: Does nothing, returns nothing by default. This function should define the given `metadata` object inside this `Plugin` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the plugins in the examples folder use the following metadata structure: `{version, author, description, allowFlags}`.
    - `defineVariable(variable)`: Does nothing, returns `variable`'s value by default. This function should define the given `variable` object inside this `Plugin` object. This is not done here for optimization purposes. (We do not need these values in a non-GUI environment.) For example, the plugins in the examples folder use the following variable structure: `{name, type, value, range, description}`. This function should return the value of the `variable` since it is used once in the constructor for the plugin's `active` property. This function should be used whenever a variable whose value is changeable from outside will be defined. 

  - `modifier callbacks`:
    - `[modifiedName, modifiedFlag, modifiedAvatar] = modifyPlayerData(playerId, name, flag, avatar, conn, auth, customData)`: set player's data just before player has joined the room. `return null` -> player is not allowed to join. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.modifyPlayerDataBefore`. host-only.
    - `newPing = modifyPlayerPing(playerId, ping, customData)`: set player's `ping`. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.modifyPlayerPingBefore`. host-only.
    - `newPing = modifyClientPing(ping, customData)`: set current player's `ping`. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.modifyClientPingBefore`. client-only.
    - `newFrameNo = modifyFrameNo(frameNo, customData)`: set current player's `frameNo`. causes your player to look laggy to your opponents, especially on extrapolated clients. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.modifyFrameNoBefore`. client-only.
    - `acceptEvent = onOperationReceived(obj, msg, globalFrameNo, clientFrameNo, customData)`:  runs for each message received from clients. `obj` is the operation type object, `msg` is the original message. you may modify `msg`'s contents here as you wish. `customData` is an optional data object returned from `room.onBeforeOperationReceived`. `return true` -> accept event, `return false` -> block message from being processed, `throw exception` -> break message sender player's connection. host-only.

  - `callbacks`:
    - `initialize(room)`: only called once while creating or joining a room, or during a call to `Room.updatePlugin`.
